abstract = {Regulatory programs that control the function of stem cells are active in cancer and confer properties that promote progression and therapy resistance. However, the impact of a stem cell-like tumor phenotype ("stemness") on the immunological properties of cancer has not been systematically explored. Using gene expression-based metrics, we evaluate the association of stemness with immune cell infiltration and genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical parameters across 21 solid cancers. We find pervasive negative associations between cancer stemness and anticancer immunity. This occurs despite high stemness cancers exhibiting increased mutation load, cancer-testis antigen expression, and intratumoral heterogeneity. Stemness was also strongly associated with cell-intrinsic suppression of endogenous retroviral expression and type I interferon signaling and increased expression of several therapeutically accessible signaling pathways. Thus, stemness is not only a fundamental process in cancer progression but may represent a unifying mechanism linking antigenicity, intratumoral heterogeneity, and immune suppression across cancers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Huntington's disease is a late onset neurological disorder caused by a trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion mutation in the HTT gene encoding for the protein huntingtin. Despite considerable ongoing research, the wild-type function of huntingtin is not yet fully understood. OBJECTIVE To improve knowledge of HTT gene regulation at the transcriptional level and inform future studies aimed at uncovering the HTT gene's normal function. METHODS The HTT gene region was functionally characterized through an in silico analysis using publicly available data sets. ChIP-seq data sets and the online STRING database were used to identify putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and protein-protein interactions within the HTT promoter region. siRNA-mediated knockdown and ChIP-qPCR of STAT1, a TF identified from the in silico analysis, were used to validate the bioinformatics screen. RESULTS 16 regions containing potential regulatory genomic markers were identified. TFBSs for 59 transcription factors (TFs) were detected in one or more of the 16 candidate regions. Using these TFs, 15 clusters of protein-protein interactions were identified using STRING. siRNA-mediated knockdown of STAT1 resulted in an increase in HTT expression, and ChIP-qPCR detected enrichment of STAT1 binding at one of the predicted regions. These assays confirmed the utility of the bioinformatic analysis. CONCLUSIONS Putative regulatory regions outside of the immediate HTT promoter region have been identified with specific protein-protein interactions. Future work will focus on in vitro and in vivo studies to examine the effect of modulating identified TFBSs and altering the levels of specific TFs of interest in regulating HTT gene expression.},

abstract = {High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) exhibits extensive malignant clonal diversity with widespread but non-random patterns of disease dissemination. We investigated whether local immune microenvironment factors shape tumor progression properties at the interface of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and cancer cells. Through multi-region study of 212 samples from 38 patients with whole-genome sequencing, immunohistochemistry, histologic image analysis, gene expression profiling, and T and B cell receptor sequencing, we identified three immunologic subtypes across samples and extensive within-patient diversity. Epithelial CD8+ TILs negatively associated with malignant diversity, reflecting immunological pruning of tumor clones inferred by neoantigen depletion, HLA I loss of heterozygosity, and spatial tracking between TÂ cell and tumor clones. In addition, combinatorial prognostic effects of mutational processes and immune properties were observed, illuminating how specific genomic aberration types associate with immune response and impact survival. We conclude that within-patient spatial immune microenvironment variation shapes intraperitoneal malignant spread, provoking new evolutionary perspectives on HGSC clonal dispersion.},

abstract = {Mutation signatures in cancer genomes reflect endogenous and exogenous mutational processes, offering insights into tumour etiology, features for prognostic and biologic stratification and vulnerabilities to be exploited therapeutically. We present a novel machine learning formalism for improved signature inference, based on multi-modal correlated topic models (MMCTM) which can at once infer signatures from both single nucleotide and structural variation counts derived from cancer genome sequencing data. We exemplify the utility of our approach on two hormone driven, DNA repair deficient cancers: breast and ovary (n=755 cases total). Our results illuminate a new age-associated structural variation signature in breast cancer, and an independently identified substructure within homologous recombination deficient (HRD) tumours in breast and ovarian cancer. Together, our study emphasizes the importance of integrating multiple mutation modes for signature discovery and patient stratification, with biological and clinical implications for DNA repair deficient cancers.},

Ab initio clustering of integrated point mutation and structural variation signatures identified seven subgroups both between and within histotypes. Prevalence of foldback inversions identified a prognostically significant HGSC group associated with inferior survival. This finding was recapitulated in two independent cohorts (n = 576 cases), transcending BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation and gene expression features of HGSC. CCOC cancers grouped according to APOBEC deamination (26{\%}) and age-related mutational signatures (40{\%}). ENOCs were divided by cases with microsatellite instability (28{\%}), with a distinct mismatch-repair mutation signature. Taken together, our work establishes the potency of the somatic genome, reflective of diverse DNA repair deficiencies, to stratify ovarian cancers into distinct biological strata within the major histotypes.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Mathelier et al.Background: With the rapid increase of whole-genome sequencing of human cancers, an important opportunity to analyze and characterize somatic mutations lying within cis-regulatory regions has emerged. A focus on protein-coding regions to identify nonsense or missense mutations disruptive to protein structure and/or function has led to important insights; however, the impact on gene expression of mutations lying within cis-regulatory regions remains under-explored. We analyzed somatic mutations from 84 matched tumor-normal whole genomes from B-cell lymphomas with accompanying gene expression measurements to elucidate the extent to which these cancers are disrupted by cis-regulatory mutations. Results: We characterize mutations overlapping a high quality set of well-annotated transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), covering a similar portion of the genome as protein-coding exons. Our results indicate that cis-regulatory mutations overlapping predicted TFBSs are enriched in promoter regions of genes involved in apoptosis or growth/proliferation. By integrating gene expression data with mutation data, our computational approach culminates with identification of cis-regulatory mutations most likely to participate in dysregulation of the gene expression program. The impact can be measured along with protein-coding mutations to highlight key mutations disrupting gene expression and pathways in cancer. Conclusions: Our study yields specific genes with disrupted expression triggered by genomic mutations in either the coding or the regulatory space. It implies that mutated regulatory components of the genome contribute substantially to cancer pathways. Our analyses demonstrate that identifying genomically altered cis-regulatory elements coupled with analysis of gene expression data will augment biological interpretation of mutational landscapes of cancers.},
