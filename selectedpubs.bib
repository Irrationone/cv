abstract = {Progress in defining genomic fitness landscapes in cancer, especially those defined by copy number alterations (CNAs), has been impeded by lack of time-series single-cell sampling of polyclonal populations and temporal statistical models 1-7. Here we generated 42,000 genomes from multi-year time-series single-cell whole-genome sequencing of breast epithelium and primary triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), revealing the nature of CNA-defined clonal fitness dynamics induced by TP53 mutation and cisplatin chemotherapy. Using a new Wright-Fisher population genetics model 8,9 to infer clonal fitness, we found that TP53 mutation alters the fitness landscape, reproducibly distributing fitness over a larger number of clones associated with distinct CNAs. Furthermore, in TNBC PDX models with mutated TP53, inferred fitness coefficients from CNA-based genotypes accurately forecast experimentally enforced clonal competition dynamics. Drug treatment in three long-term serially passaged TNBC PDXs resulted in cisplatin-resistant clones emerging from low-fitness phylogenetic lineages in the untreated setting. Conversely, high-fitness clones from treatment-naive controls were eradicated, signalling an inversion of the fitness landscape. Finally, upon release of drug, selection pressure dynamics were reversed, indicating a fitness cost of treatment resistance. Together, our findings define clonal fitness linked to both CNA and therapeutic resistance in polyclonal tumours. Quantifying cellular fitness and its causal mechanisms in heterogeneous, polyclonal cancer cell populations remain unresolved problems, impeding progress in developing effective and durable therapeutic strategies 1-7. Despite well-documented genomic plasticity in tumours, the question of how CNA-induced changes in the genome architecture drive aetiological and drug resistance 10 processes remains understudied 11-13. The cancer field has generally lacked serial measurements from patient-derived tissues to directly observe cancer evolution over realistic timescales with single-cell resolution 1,2,4,14-21. This has hindered the thorough investigation of causal factors driving selection, unlike in other biological systems 22. Here we use single-genome-derived CNAs as clone-defining heritable genotypes to establish quantitative fitness attributes that serve as predictive measures of polyclonal growth potential. Our work has implications in at least three areas: predicting evolution in cancer; understanding how genomic instability processes leading to CNAs confer fitness; and parsing long-term kinetics of drug resistance in polyclonal cancer cell populations. Modelling clonal fitness and selection We developed an experimental and computational platform consisting of three components: time-series sampling and single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS) of immortal cell lines and PDX (Extended Data Fig. 1a, b); scalable phylogenetics for single-cell genomes (sitka 23 , Extended Data Fig. 1c); and a population genetics inspired (Wright-Fisher diffusion process) model of fitness (fitClone, Extended Data Fig. 1d, e, Supplementary Table 1). Using observed longitudinal clonal-abundance measurements as input, fitClone simultaneously estimates the growth trajectory (Z i) and fitness coefficient (s i) for each clone i in the population. The model can be used to forecast evolutionary trajectories, and its posterior probability densities can reflect evidence of positive selection in polyclonal systems. Details of fitClone, including theoretical assumptions and limitations of the model are discussed in the Supplementary Information.},

abstract = {Background: Accurately predicting outcomes for cancer patients with COVID-19 has been clinically challenging. Numerous clinical variables have been retrospectively associated with disease severity, but the predictive value of these variables, and how multiple variables interact to increase risk, remains unclear. Methods: We used machine learning algorithms to predict COVID-19 severity in 354 cancer patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. Using clinical variables only collected on or before a patient's COVID-19 positive date (time zero), we sought to classify patients into one of three possible future outcomes: Severe-early (the patient required high levels of oxygen support within 3 days of being tested positive for COVID-19), Severe-late (the patient required high levels of oxygen after 3 days), and Non-severe (the patient never required oxygen support). Results: Our algorithm classified patients into these classes with an AUROC ranging from 70-85%, significantly outperforming prior methods and univariate analyses. Critically, classification accuracy is highest when using a potpourri of clinical variables — including patient demographics, pre-existing diagnoses, laboratory and radiological work, and underlying cancer type — suggesting that COVID-19 in cancer patients comes with numerous, combinatorial risk factors. Conclusions: Overall, we provide a computational tool that can identify high-risk patients early in their disease progression, which could aid in clinical decision-making and selecting treatment options.},

abstract = {Background: Lumbar puncture (LP) is a frequently performed diagnostic and therapeutic procedure in oncology patients. Transfusing to a minimum preprocedural platelet threshold of 50 × 109/L is widely upheld without good quality evidence. The objective was to compare the outcomes of LPs performed with platelets above and below this threshold. An increased risk of adverse events in patients with lower platelet counts was not expected. As a corollary, transfusion reaction rates incurred by transfusing to this recommended threshold are also reported. Methods: A total of 2259 LPs performed on 1137 oncology patients (adult, n = 871, and pediatric, n = 266) were retrospectively analyzed between February 2011 and December 2017. The incidence of LP-related complications for groups above and below the minimum platelet threshold was compared. Traumatic tap was defined as 500 or more red blood cells per high-power field in the cerebral spinal fluid. Groups were compared using the 2-Proportion Z-test and Fisher exact test. Results: At time of LP, the total number of events with platelets less than 50 × 109/L and 50 × 109/L or greater were 110 and 2149, respectively. There were no significant differences in LP-associated complications between patients with platelet counts above or below 50 × 109/L (P =.29). Patients with a pre-LP platelet count of less than 50 × 109/L had a higher proportion of traumatic taps (P <.001). Three patients developed transfusion-related adverse events. Conclusion: Patients with platelet counts less than 50 × 109/L did not have a higher incidence of clinically significant post–lumbar puncture complications (P =.29).},

Integrative genomic and transcriptomic analysis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) from the British Columbia population-based registry uncovered recurrent biallelic TMEM30A loss-of-function mutations, which were associated with a favorable outcome and uniquely observed in DLBCL. Using TMEM30A-knockout systems, increased accumulation of chemotherapy drugs was observed in TMEM30A-knockout cell lines and TMEM30A-mutated primary cells, explaining the improved treatment outcome. Furthermore, we found increased tumor-associated macrophages and an enhanced effect of anti-CD47 blockade limiting tumor growth in TMEM30A-knockout models. By contrast, we show that TMEM30A loss-of-function increases B-cell signaling following antigen stimulation—a mechanism conferring selective advantage during B-cell lymphoma development. Our data highlight a multifaceted role for TMEM30A in B-cell lymphomagenesis, and characterize intrinsic and extrinsic vulnerabilities of cancer cells that can be therapeutically exploited. Integrative analysis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma uncovers that biallelic mutations on TMEM30A are associated with a favorable outcome and enhanced sensitivity to CD47 blockade.},

Hemopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) results in transient monocyte depletion, but the factors that regulate recovery of monocyte populations are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated whether the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is associated with the recovery of monocyte homeostasis after HCT. Methods: We performed a single-center, prospective, pilot study of 18 recipients of either autologous or allogeneic HCT. Serial blood and stool samples were collected from each patient during their HCT hospitalization. Analysis of the gut microbiota was done using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and flow cytometric analysis was used to characterize the phenotypic composition of monocyte populations. Results: Dynamic fluctuations in monocyte reconstitution occurred after HCT and large differences were observed in monocyte frequency among patients over time. Recovery of absolute monocyte counts and monocyte subsets showed significant variability across the heterogeneous transplant types and conditioning intensities; no relationship to the microbiota composition was observed in this small cohort. Conclusion: A relationship between the microbiota composition and monocyte homeostasis could not be firmly established in this pilot study.},

Single-cell expression profiling identified a novel HL-associated subset of T cells with prominent expression of the inhibitory receptor LAG3, and functional analyses established this LAG3+ T cell population as a mediator of immunosuppression. Multiplexed spatial assessment of immune cells in the microenvironment also revealed increased LAG3+ T cells in the direct vicinity of MHC class-II deficient tumor cells. Our findings provide novel insights into TME biology and suggest new approaches to immune checkpoint targeting in HL.},

However, the sources of technical and biological variation in primary solid tumor tissues and patient-derived mouse xenografts for scRNA-seq are not well understood. We use low temperature (6 °C) protease and collagenase (37 °C) to identify the transcriptional signatures associated with tissue dissociation across a diverse scRNA-seq dataset comprising 155,165 cells from patient cancer tissues, patient-derived breast cancer xenografts, and cancer cell lines. We observe substantial variation in standard quality control metrics of cell viability across conditions and tissues. From the contrast between tissue protease dissociation at 37 °C or 6 °C, we observe that collagenase digestion results in a stress response. We derive a core gene set of 512 heat shock and stress response genes, including FOS and JUN, induced by collagenase (37 °C), which are minimized by dissociation with a cold active protease (6 °C). While induction of these genes was highly conserved across all cell types, cell type-specific responses to collagenase digestion were observed in patient tissues. The method and conditions of tumor dissociation influence cell yield and transcriptome state and are both tissue- and cell-type dependent. Interpretation of stress pathway expression differences in cancer single-cell studies, including components of surface immune recognition such as MHC class I, may be especially confounded. We define a core set of 512 genes that can assist with the identification of such effects in dissociated scRNA-seq experiments.},

Often, investigators wish to assign cells to cell types through unsupervised clustering followed by manual annotation or via ‘mapping' to existing data. However, manual interpretation scales poorly to large datasets, mapping approaches require purified or pre-annotated data and both are prone to batch effects. To overcome these issues, we present CellAssign, a probabilistic model that leverages prior knowledge of cell-type marker genes to annotate single-cell RNA sequencing data into predefined or de novo cell types. CellAssign automates the process of assigning cells in a highly scalable manner across large datasets while controlling for batch and sample effects. We demonstrate the advantages of CellAssign through extensive simulations and analysis of tumor microenvironment composition in high-grade serous ovarian cancer and follicular lymphoma.

abstract = {The exclusion of immune cells from the tumor microenvironment has been associated with poor prognosis in the majority of cancers. We report that when considering 21 solid cancer types, immune cell exclusion is widely associated with the presence of a stem cell-like phenotype in tumors (“stemness”). Stemness positively correlates with higher intratumoral heterogeneity, possibly by protecting antigenic clones from elimination by the immune system. The activation of a stemness program appears to limit antitumor immune responses via tumor cell-intrinsic silencing of endogenous retrovirus expression, repression of type I interferon signaling, and up-regulation of immunosuppressive checkpoints. Our work suggests that targeting the stemness phenotype in cancer will promote T cell infiltration and render tumors more responsive to immune control. Regulatory programs that control the function of stem cells are active in cancer and confer properties that promote progression and therapy resistance. However, the impact of a stem cell-like tumor phenotype (“stemness”) on the immunological properties of cancer has not been systematically explored. Using gene-expression–based metrics, we evaluated the association of stemness with immune cell infiltration and genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical parameters across 21 solid cancers. We found pervasive negative associations between cancer stemness and anticancer immunity. This occurred despite high stemness cancers exhibiting increased mutation load, cancer-testis antigen expression, and intratumoral heterogeneity. Stemness was also strongly associated with cell-intrinsic suppression of endogenous retroviruses and type I IFN signaling, and increased expression of multiple therapeutically accessible immunosuppressive pathways. Thus, stemness is not only a fundamental process in cancer progression but may provide a mechanistic link between antigenicity, intratumoral heterogeneity, and immune suppression across cancers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Huntington's disease is a late onset neurological disorder caused by a trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion mutation in the HTT gene encoding for the protein huntingtin. Despite considerable ongoing research, the wild-type function of huntingtin is not yet fully understood. OBJECTIVE To improve knowledge of HTT gene regulation at the transcriptional level and inform future studies aimed at uncovering the HTT gene's normal function. METHODS The HTT gene region was functionally characterized through an in silico analysis using publicly available data sets. ChIP-seq data sets and the online STRING database were used to identify putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and protein-protein interactions within the HTT promoter region. siRNA-mediated knockdown and ChIP-qPCR of STAT1, a TF identified from the in silico analysis, were used to validate the bioinformatics screen. RESULTS 16 regions containing potential regulatory genomic markers were identified. TFBSs for 59 transcription factors (TFs) were detected in one or more of the 16 candidate regions. Using these TFs, 15 clusters of protein-protein interactions were identified using STRING. siRNA-mediated knockdown of STAT1 resulted in an increase in HTT expression, and ChIP-qPCR detected enrichment of STAT1 binding at one of the predicted regions. These assays confirmed the utility of the bioinformatic analysis. CONCLUSIONS Putative regulatory regions outside of the immediate HTT promoter region have been identified with specific protein-protein interactions. Future work will focus on in vitro and in vivo studies to examine the effect of modulating identified TFBSs and altering the levels of specific TFs of interest in regulating HTT gene expression.},

abstract = {High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) exhibits extensive malignant clonal diversity with widespread but non-random patterns of disease dissemination. We investigated whether local immune microenvironment factors shape tumor progression properties at the interface of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and cancer cells. Through multi-region study of 212 samples from 38 patients with whole-genome sequencing, immunohistochemistry, histologic image analysis, gene expression profiling, and T and B cell receptor sequencing, we identified three immunologic subtypes across samples and extensive within-patient diversity. Epithelial CD8+ TILs negatively associated with malignant diversity, reflecting immunological pruning of tumor clones inferred by neoantigen depletion, HLA I loss of heterozygosity, and spatial tracking between T cell and tumor clones. In addition, combinatorial prognostic effects of mutational processes and immune properties were observed, illuminating how specific genomic aberration types associate with immune response and impact survival. We conclude that within-patient spatial immune microenvironment variation shapes intraperitoneal malignant spread, provoking new evolutionary perspectives on HGSC clonal dispersion.},

abstract = {We studied the whole-genome point mutation and structural variation patterns of 133 tumors (59 high-grade serous (HGSC), 35 clear cell (CCOC), 29 endometrioid (ENOC), and 10 adult granulosa cell (GCT)) as a substrate for class discovery in ovarian cancer. Ab initio clustering of integrated point mutation and structural variation signatures identified seven subgroups both between and within histotypes. Prevalence of foldback inversions identified a prognostically significant HGSC group associated with inferior survival. This finding was recapitulated in two independent cohorts (n = 576 cases), transcending BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation and gene expression features of HGSC. CCOC cancers grouped according to APOBEC deamination (26%) and age-related mutational signatures (40%). ENOCs were divided by cases with microsatellite instability (28%), with a distinct mismatch-repair mutation signature. Taken together, our work establishes the potency of the somatic genome, reflective of diverse DNA repair deficiencies, to stratify ovarian cancers into distinct biological strata within the major histotypes.},

For this 2016 release, we expanded the JASPAR CORE collection with 494 new TF binding profiles (315 in vertebrates, 11 in nematodes, 3 in insects, 1 in fungi and 164 in plants) and updated 59 profiles (58 in vertebrates and 1 in fungi). The introduced profiles represent an 83% expansion and 10% update when compared to the previous release. We updated the structural annotation of the TF DNA binding domains (DBDs) following a published hierarchical structural classification. In addition, we introduced 130 transcription factor flexible models trained on ChIP-seq data for vertebrates, which capture dinucleotide dependencies within TF binding sites. This new JASPAR release is accompanied by a new web tool to infer JASPAR TF binding profiles recognized by a given TF protein sequence. Moreover, we provide the users with a Ruby module complementing the JASPAR API to ease programmatic access and use of the JASPAR collection of profiles. Finally, we provide the JASPAR2016 R/Bioconductor data package with the data of this release.},

@article{Mathelier2015,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Mathelier et al.Background: With the rapid increase of whole-genome sequencing of human cancers, an important opportunity to analyze and characterize somatic mutations lying within cis-regulatory regions has emerged. A focus on protein-coding regions to identify nonsense or missense mutations disruptive to protein structure and/or function has led to important insights; however, the impact on gene expression of mutations lying within cis-regulatory regions remains under-explored. We analyzed somatic mutations from 84 matched tumor-normal whole genomes from B-cell lymphomas with accompanying gene expression measurements to elucidate the extent to which these cancers are disrupted by cis-regulatory mutations. Results: We characterize mutations overlapping a high quality set of well-annotated transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), covering a similar portion of the genome as protein-coding exons. Our results indicate that cis-regulatory mutations overlapping predicted TFBSs are enriched in promoter regions of genes involved in apoptosis or growth/proliferation. By integrating gene expression data with mutation data, our computational approach culminates with identification of cis-regulatory mutations most likely to participate in dysregulation of the gene expression program. The impact can be measured along with protein-coding mutations to highlight key mutations disrupting gene expression and pathways in cancer. Conclusions: Our study yields specific genes with disrupted expression triggered by genomic mutations in either the coding or the regulatory space. It implies that mutated regulatory components of the genome contribute substantially to cancer pathways. Our analyses demonstrate that identifying genomically altered cis-regulatory elements coupled with analysis of gene expression data will augment biological interpretation of mutational landscapes of cancers.},
